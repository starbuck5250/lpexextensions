# lpexextensions
Lpex extensions for IBM Rational Developer for IBM i

This is a personal project to extend Lpex.

The first thing I'm trying is to convert fixed-format D-specifications to fully free.
This is quite rough at the moment because I am not a Java programmer by trade, 
so the Java could use quite a bit of refactoring.  I also need to stop and think
about writing Junit tests for it as well.
